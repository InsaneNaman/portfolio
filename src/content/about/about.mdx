I am a Computer Science Engineer and Full Stack Web Developer who has been playing around Web for the last 4-5 years. I ❤️ JavaScript but that doesn't hold me back from trying different things. One can always find me trying and learning about different things like Tech, Space, Science and much more.

I love the idea of innovation and building new things which eventually led me to the journey of startups. I got into Y Combinator's Startup School where I learnt the ins and out of the startup. Now, I understand that it takes a lot more than just code to make a Great Product/s. 😉
